        <h3 class="section-text">Sleeping pills treat insomnia by making you feel drowsy and relaxed. Sleep aids, including natural ones like melatonin, can cause side effects. You may feel confused or sleepy during the day. Some people walk or eat in their sleep (parasomnia). Other nondrug therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are better at improving sleep.</h3>
