                       <br> Dreaming is one of the most impractical things a scientist could choose to study.
                        Dreams are a universal part of human experience. But they are by nature subjective.
                        We can’t share them. How can we understand dreams in general then, beyond the vague,
                        untrustworthy recollections that we have of them when we’re awake? How can we study them
                        scientifically and answer the question: Why do we dream?

                           <br> People have been trying to explain dreams for millennia. For a long time, 
                            these explanations were rooted in spiritual beings outside of our bodies; 
                            dreams were understood as messages from gods or as communications from our ancestors.
                             The scientific study of dreams as something that happens in the brain began with Freud 
                             right at the dawn of the 20th century.

                <p>  Dreams are stories and images that our minds create while we sleep. They can be entertaining, fun, 
                    romantic, disturbing, frightening, and sometimes bizarre.
                    There are several theories about why we dream. Are dreams merely part of the sleep cycle, or do they serve some other purpose?
                    Possible explanations include: representing unconscious desires and wishes , interpreting random signals from the brain and body during sleep
                    consolidating and processing information gathered during the day ,working as a form of psychotherapy
                    From evidence and new research methodologies, researchers have speculated that dreaming serves the following functions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>offline memory reprocessing, in which the brain consolidates learning and memory tasks and supports and recordsTrusted Source waking consciousness </li>
                        <li>helping develop cognitiveTrusted Source capabilities </li>
                        <li>reflecting unconscious mental functionTrusted Source in a psychoanalytic way </li>
                        <li>a unique state of consciousness that incorporates experienceTrusted Source of the present, processing of the past, and preparation for the future </li>
                        <li> a psychological space where overwhelming, contradictory, or highly complex notions can be brought togetherTrusted Source by the dreaming ego, notions that would be unsettling while awake, serving the need for psychological balance and equilibrium</li>

         <h1 class="article-title-dream">What is dream ?</h1>
         <div class="article-content">
             <div class="div-text">
             <p> 
                 A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in 
                 the mind during certain stages of sleep. Humans spend about two hours dreaming per night, and each 
                 dream lasts around 5 to 20 minutes.
                 The content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific, philosophical and religious interest
                 throughout recorded history. Dream interpretation, practiced by the Babylonians in the third millennium 
                 BCE and even earlier by the ancient Sumerians, figures prominently in religious texts in several 
                 traditions, and has played a lead role in psychotherapy.The scientific study of dreams is called 
                 oneirology.Most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing 
                 hypotheses regarding dream function. It is not known where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a 
                 single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of 
                 dreaming is for the body or mind.
                 The human dream experience and what to make of it have undergone sizable shifts over the course of 
                 history.Long ago, according to writings from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, dreams dictated post-dream
                 behaviors to an extent sharply reduced in later millennia. These ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation
                  dreams, where a dream figure, usually a deity or a prominent forebear, commands the dreamer to take specific
                   actions and may predict future events. The brain activity capable of formulating such dreams, 
                   rare among literate people in later eras, conforms to the bicameral mentality hypothesized by Julian Jaynes
                    as dominant into the second or first millennium BCE. Framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time.
                 Dreaming and sleep are intertwined. Dreams occur mainly in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of 
                 sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. Because REM sleep is detectable
                 in many species, and because research suggests that all mammals experience REM, linking dreams to 
                 REM sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream. However, humans dream during non-REM sleep, also,
                 and not all REM awakenings elicit dream reports.To be studied, a dream must first be reduced to a verbal
                 report, which is an account of the subject's memory of the dream, not the subject's dream experience 
                 itself. So, dreaming by non-humans is currently unprovable, as is dreaming by human fetuses and
                 pre-verbal infants.

            For humans in the pre-classical era, and continuing for some non-literate populations into modern times, dreams are
            believed to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from gods or other external entities.
            Ancient Egyptians believed that dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation, and thus they would induce 
            (or "incubate") dreams. They went to sanctuaries and slept on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, 
            comfort, or healing from the gods.From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological 
            requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness.
             Robert (1886),[38] a physician from Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have 
             the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully 
             developed during the day. In dreams, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into
            memory. Freud, whose dream studies focused on interpreting dreams, not explaining how or why humans dream, disputed 
            Robert's hypothesis and proposed that dreams preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise
             would awaken the dreamer. Freud wrote that dreams "serve the purpose of prolonging sleep instead of waking up. 
             Dreams are the GUARDIANS of sleep and not its disturbers."
             A turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953, when Science published the Aserinsky and
              Kleitman paper establishing REM sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to REM sleep .
               Until and even after publication of the Solms 2000 paper that certified the separability of REM sleep and 
               dream phenomena, many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact been studying not 
               dreams but measurable REM sleep.

        Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have
        some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the 
        dream. Dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to 
        control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as "lucid"—a lucid dream is any dream during
        which the dreamer knows they are dreaming.The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.
        "Oneironaut" is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.
        In 1975, psychologist Keith Hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream. On April 12, 1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid, the subject and Hearne's co-author on the resulting article, Alan Worsley, successfully carried out this task.[82] Years later, psychophysiologist Stephen LaBerge conducted similar work including:
        
        Using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams.
        Comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake and while dreaming.
